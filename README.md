# Ceph Cluster Time Series Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on performing **Time Series Analysis** on a Ceph cluster to understand and predict **Recovery Time** and **Replication Rate**. The work spans data analysis using public datasets, evaluation of a custom Ceph cluster, and deployment of an interactive web application for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction.

## 🔍 Metrics Considered

### For **Recovery Time**:
- `OSD Recovery Time (s)` – Time taken for Object Storage Daemons to recover.
- `PG Recovery Time (s)` – Time for Placement Groups to recover.
- `Backfill Rate (MB/s)` – Data rate at which backfilling occurs.
- `Recovery Throughput (MB/s)` – Total throughput during recovery.
- `Degraded PGs Count` – Number of degraded Placement Groups.

### For **Replication Rate**:
- `ceph_osd_objects_unfound` – Count of objects that couldn’t be located.
- `ceph_osd_scrub_count` – Number of regular data scrubbing operations.
- `ceph_osd_deep_scrub_count` – Number of deep scrubbing operations.
- `ceph_osd_replication_latency` – Latency experienced during replication.
- `ceph_osd_recovery_bw` – Bandwidth used for recovery.
- `ceph_osd_primary` – Number of primary OSDs.
- `ceph_osd_peering_state` – Status of OSDs in the peering process.

###  Inputs Required (CSV/Excel):
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Time of metric capture |
| `workload size` | Size of workload (e.g., 10GB, 5.5GB) |
| `data type` | Type of data: block, RGW, file, object |

##  App Functionality

### EDA (Analysis)
- Plot workload vs. recovery/replication time
- Plot data type vs. recovery/replication time
- Analyze active I/O operations, config, and object count impact on recovery
- Plot replication factor impact on replication rate

### Recovery Time Prediction
- Inputs: workload, data type, I/O operations, config, object count, timestamp
- Output: Predicted recovery time with model accuracy

###  Replication Rate Prediction
- Inputs: workload, data type, replication factor, timestamp
- Output: Predicted replication rate with model accuracy

## Key Learnings

- Ceph metrics vary significantly across versions; Ceph Pacific's metrics were carefully selected for visual and statistical correlation.
- Recovery time and replication rate are influenced by configuration, workload, data type, and object size.
- Real-time analysis and prediction is feasible using lightweight regression models backed by historical metric behavior.
