# Ceph Cluster Time Series Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on performing **Time Series Analysis** on a Ceph cluster to understand and predict **Recovery Time** and **Replication Rate**. The work spans data analysis using public datasets, evaluation of a custom Ceph cluster, and deployment of an interactive web application for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction.

**Folder:** [`ceph eda app`](https://github.com/Ahana-c/hpe_2025_cephcluster/tree/main/ceph%20eda%20app)  

###  Inputs Required (CSV/Excel):
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Time of metric capture |
| `workload size` | Size of workload (e.g., 10GB, 5.5GB) |
| `data type` | Type of data: block, RGW, file, object |
| `active i/o operations` | Number of concurrent input operations |
| `recovery config` | Config mode: aggressive, default, throttled |
| `number of objects` | Count of objects in the cluster |
| `replication factor` | Number of replicas (e.g., 2, 3) |
| `recovery time` | Actual measured recovery time |
| `replication rate` | Actual measured replication rate |

##  App Functionality

### EDA (Analysis)
- Plot workload vs. recovery/replication time
- Plot data type vs. recovery/replication time
- Analyze active I/O operations, config, and object count impact on recovery
- Plot replication factor impact on replication rate

### Recovery Time Prediction
- Inputs: workload, data type, I/O operations, config, object count, timestamp
- Output: Predicted recovery time with model accuracy

###  Replication Rate Prediction
- Inputs: workload, data type, replication factor, timestamp
- Output: Predicted replication rate with model accuracy

## Key Learnings

- Ceph metrics vary significantly across versions; Ceph Pacific's metrics were carefully selected for visual and statistical correlation.
- Recovery time and replication rate are influenced by configuration, workload, data type, and object size.
- Real-time analysis and prediction is feasible using lightweight regression models backed by historical metric behavior.
